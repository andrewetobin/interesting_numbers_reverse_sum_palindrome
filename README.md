# Code Challenge

## Interesting numbers: reverse number, sum with original and make a palindrome

**I did not write this code.** Simply watched code challenge and got sucked in with great interest.

## Set up

1. Take the number 47
2. Reverse it. 74
3. Add them together and you get 121 which is a palindrome. (reads exactly the same forwards and backwards)

# Challenge
Find the first 25 numbers that follow same pattern and result in a palindrome larger than 1000.
